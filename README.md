# Course Details 
Our goal is to start training our brains to think **holistically** allow us to pivot and learn quickly **as Swift & iOS evolves** along side ourselves and our applications. 
We will confront **ambiguity** head on and build the resilience necessary to manage it. 
We will **understand the big picture** to allow us to understand which strategies to deploy & when they are best suited. 
We will build the **intuition** and **nomenclature** necessary to best let us tackle problems confidently and participate in higher level discussions productively.

## Teaching Style 
I teach starting with an adapted socratic seminar: 
1) Start with what a student already knows 
2) Followed with probing questions to build connection between two unconnected ideas
3) Then follow with the nomenclature and what that looks like in Computer Science. 

This de-mystifies seemingly complex topics into digestable piece. It also increases retention rate of new material. This is an adpated technique I have refined over thousands and thousands of hours of tutoring across subjects over the last 10+ years. 

## Course Execution 
There will be a test per each unit that will be comprised of information covered in each section quiz. 
There will be assignments throughout the course including writing, code adapation, coding, pair programming, disucssions, kahoot sections, and other mediums.
There will be a dicussion class at the start of each Section, and a end of Section Quiz at the end of Setion. 
Each student will work through one iOS Application throughout the course building up to deploying it on the AppStore, if they so choose. These will be a simple, version one of their final application idea that fits particular criteria. 

## Course Organization 
For Detailed Agenda's (Samples): see the **Issues** Section. 
For Coding Samples, 

Samples will be provided with less detail that are not relevant for anyone who is not currently taking the course, i.e. due dates, discussion posts, videos of classes etc to protect privacy and anonymity of the students. Some slideshows may be paried down from word clouds, details, or other assignments only provided to paying students.  

## Course Syllabus  
This is typically over an 18 - 22 week course depending on class frequency. 

### Unit 1: Fundamental iOS Application Structure
- **Section 1: MVC, MVP, MVVM, VIPER &  CLEAN Architecture**
- **Section 2: Creational, Behavioral & Structural Design Patterns (including Software Design Principles)**
- **Section 3: Communication Patterns (Notifications, Delegates, and Callbacks)**

## Unit 2: View Layout Composition, View Creation & iOS Fundamentals
- **Section 1: iOS Development Structure (View Hierarchy, Protocols)**
- **Section 2: View Layout Composition (Storyboard, programatic, compositional, and frame-based)**
- **Section 3: iOS UI Creation (Creaing Your Own App)**

## Unit 3: Concurrency, Networking, & App Development
This section is subject to changes based on students knowledge level, and need to know basic. The goal is to expose brand new develoeprs to the concept, ideas and nomeclature around core topics to allow them to ask the right questions.
- **Unit 3, Section 1: Networking (JSON, HTTP Requests, etc) & Introduction to Memory Management**
- **Unit 3, Section 2: Concurrency (Serial & Concurrent Queue Basics, Actors, Callbacks, Dispatch Queue)**
- **Unit 3, Section 3: App Development (App Store Submission, Upkeep, etc)**
